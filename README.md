I've created a bookshelf made of a 14x9 grid of squares. In each square are three neopixels hooked up to two Fadecandy controllers and a Raspberry Pi. This project contains some javascript games created for this bookshelf grid.

This project requires the Fadecandy Server to be set up and opc.js from https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy

Se the wiki for more details on how my bookshelf was made with som videos of the finished product.
